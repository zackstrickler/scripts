# Automated Scripts Repository

Welcome to the **Automated Scripts Repository**! This is the place where I am actively uploading and maintaining various automated scripts for different tasks. These scripts are designed to automate processes, improve productivity, and make complex tasks more efficient.

## Repository Purpose

This repository serves as a central hub for storing all of my automated scripts. The scripts vary in function and complexity, ranging from simple automation tasks to more advanced solutions. Whether it's managing system configurations, batch processing, or security-related tasks, you‚Äôll find scripts designed for a wide range of use cases.

### Key Features
- **Task Automation**: Scripts that automate repetitive tasks.
- **System Configuration**: Scripts for managing and configuring systems.
- **Productivity**: Tools and scripts to streamline workflows.
- **Security Automation**: Scripts focused on enhancing cybersecurity and maintaining system integrity.

## Scripts Overview

### [Security Script](./Security%20Script.ps1)

The **Security Script** is designed to enhance system security by performing tasks like disabling unnecessary services, applying security configurations, and running system scans. It ensures that the system is hardened against potential vulnerabilities.

### [Shutdown Script](./Shutdown%20Script.ps1)

The **Shutdown Script** automates the shutdown process for a Windows system. It allows for controlled shutdown or restart operations, useful for system maintenance or energy-saving measures in environments that require frequent shutdown operations.

## Work in Progress üõ†Ô∏è

Please note that this repository is **still a work in progress**. I am continuously updating and improving the scripts, and you may find that some scripts are in development or may require refinement.

I welcome any suggestions or feedback to make these scripts more robust and efficient.
